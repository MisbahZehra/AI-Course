Q1) Write a Python function to check if a number is even or odd.
def check_even_odd(number): """ Checks if a number is even or odd.
Args:
    number (int): The number to check.
    
Returns:
    str: "Even" if the number is even, "Odd" if the number is odd.
"""
if number % 2 == 0:
    return "Even"
else:
    return "Odd"
 num = int(input("Enter a number: ")) print(f"The number {num} is {check_even_odd(num)}.")



Q2) Simple ATM Machine Create a simple ATM program where the
user has to enter a PIN to proceed.
● The correct PIN should be 1234.
● If the user enters the correct PIN, display a menu that allows the user
to:
○ Check Balance (display a fixed balance, e.g., 1000).
○ Withdraw Money (ask the user how much they want to
withdraw and deduct that amount from the balance).
 
● If the user enters an incorrect PIN, print &quot;Incorrect PIN&quot; and terminate
the program.




Q3)Write a program that asks the user to enter a username and
password.
● The correct username should be &quot;admin&quot; and the correct password
should be the numeric value 12345.
● If both the username and password are correct, the program should
display &quot;Login Successful!&quot;.
● If the username is incorrect, display &quot;Incorrect username&quot;.
● If the password is incorrect, display &quot;Incorrect password&quot;.

CODE:
def login_system():
    """
    A simple login program that verifies a username and password.
    """
    correct_username = "admin"
    correct_password = 12345
 
    # Prompt the user for username and password
    username = input("Enter username: ")
    try:
        password = int(input("Enter password: "))
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid password format. Password must be numeric.")
        return
 
    # Validate the username and password
    if username != correct_username:
        print("Incorrect username")
    elif password != correct_password:
        print("Incorrect password")
    else:
        print("Login Successful!")
 
# Run the login system
login_system()
